With the intention of integrating to the ISMIR community the
composers, technologists, performers, and creative practitioners
making use of music information for creating music, ISMIR 2020
announced an international call for musical works for inclusion in the
conferenceâ€™s concert program.

The submissions were scanned for relevance by the ISMIR2020 Music
Program co-chairs and at least two additional reviewers per musical
piece were assigned to provide evaluations. The final decision for
inclusion in the ISMIR Music Program was made based on the reviewers'
evaluations and comments.
