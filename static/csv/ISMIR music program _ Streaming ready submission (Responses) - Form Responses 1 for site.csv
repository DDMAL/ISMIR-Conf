State changes interpolate between unique parameter configurations of the space composed through trial-and-error experimentation using themes/variations from J. S. Bach’s Chaconne (Partita #2). Bespoke textural and ambient microsonic processing of the violin’s sound by the composer is driven primarily by pitch estimation and other spectral features. In the sound design, Tim Hecker, William Basinski, Vangelis, Gas, and Klaus Schulze are all points of reference, and the ethos of the work is informed by the references of the latter two to late German Romantic music. The intention with performing this system using a famous piece from the violin repertoire (rather than free improvisation, the typical modus operandi of the composer) is to demonstrate to classically-trained musicians how they might discover novelty with the use of elaborate spatial augmentation systems as demonstrated by this performance.

With its vast timbral range, the human voice provides an immense world of possibilities in electroacoustic music. Despite the rich history of live vocal feature extraction, existing work frequently puts more focus on complex vocal sounds and textures, while engaging very little with the core fundamentals of standard vocalization – namely, the five primary singing vowels. Hence, VPF uses Max 8’s spectral descriptors libraries in conjunction with Wekinator’s machine learning models to train the system to detect one of the five core vowels (“ooh”, “ee”, “eh”, “ah”, or “oh”). The predicted vowel, along with the raw audio features themselves, are then used to control various parameters of live input processing, including harmonization, delay time (with feedback), and stereo spread.  Using this performance system, Spectre was composed as an improvisatory, experimental vocal work showcasing the hauntingly compelling sound worlds that can be created using Vocal PerFormants. The work largely aims to highlight and juxtapose VPF’s response to the core vowels in relation to more “complex” vocal sounds such as diphthongs, vocal fry, and unpitched breathy sounds. It also serves as a way to engage with a notion of aestheticizing “errors” in classification.

",https://busevin.art,UTC +1,1,Transcognition,385,3,"1.	This piece is created by 32 Multimodal Multiple Cognitive Agents (following the MAS paradigm [4]) that have the capacity of creating music in competitive or collaborative modes (that´s why the work is called transcognition, at the same time, the environment changes in a constant evolving relation). The work begins with all the agents in competitive mode. Each Agent creates its own music trying to generate the most interesting music to get the audience focused in its activity. Periodically, they check if what they do is really the most significant, if they decide that not, then, they become collaborative (they have the same intelligence to measure it). Slowly, all the agents become collaborative.   Two minutes after the last agent becomes collaborative, the work finishes automatically. Once they become collaborative they cannot return to competitive mode.",,https://wetransfer.com/downloads/79e39f88b1047d74107e70f3abc30e7c20200903152629/91867d1382b5879e8a518a2a9ec3e21420200903152809/8002b2https://wetransfer.com/downloads/79e39f88b1047d74107e70f3abc30e7c20200903152629/91867d1382b5879e8a518a2a9ec3e21420200903152809/8002b2,x,https://youtu.be/7tkXsqs1k_s,https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1E5411j7Qg,https://www.dropbox.com/s/pu3idqjybckhxns/ISMIR-385.mp4?dl=0

It all resonates a little too much with the natural thunderstorm in my hyperactive head.  // To cope, I attempt mindfulness. Actually, it is more to really enjoy my privileged life as is: an incredibly difficult task. I therefore share here a sonic musing on the pleasure of contemplating the complex ebb and flow of a million things that fight for attention, when I manage to lower the grip of its frenzy on my angst, guilt and powerlessness, and just observe it with an open curiosity.  // Attempts at Stillness was written in the composer’s studio between April and November 2017.

",https://sites.rmit.edu.au/alu/,UTC+11,11,Trees,409,3,"What do programs that manipulate trees sound like? This composition tries to find out. The running of a program is like a narrative: Once upon a time there was a poem about trees. The first word was “I”. It was stored at the root of a binary tree. The second word was “think”. It was stored in a node pointed to by the right pointer of the “I” node. But this was a splay tree, and so the two nodes were rearranged so that “think” was at the root. And so the story continues. The inspiration behind the composition was wondering whether following the construction of a search tree would result in a fractal-like composition, with related patterns occurring, to provide repetition for the listener — a method of providing compositional structure without resorting to existing forms and traditional techniques. A second inspiration behind the work was the idea of sonifying code, to provide feedback to a programmer in a new way, for example, about where possible inefficiencies lie. In the case of the chosen algorithm and data structure, each time two words are compared, the words are repeated for each character that needs to be compared, leading to the sequence “that, think, that, think, that, think” being sung, due to the first three characters needing to be compared. In terms of the concert theme of “music information”, the work communicates information about a computer program via musical output.

During his BSc, MSc, MPhil and PhD, at Shiraz and Tarbiat Modarres Universities, Queen Mary, University of London, and London Metropolitan University he developed algorithms for music transcription and maqàm/mode recognition. He was highly commended at SSMS 2007 for Analysis and Classification of Persian Musical Modes, and his performance with audience participation won the first prize in AudioMostly 2017. 

He also makes music for films and Radio and TV channels. Peyman has been researching the possibilities of pushing the boundaries of the Persian music and santur performance.  He is currently developing a content-based personal music recommender system.
