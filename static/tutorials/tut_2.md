This tutorial will briefly summarize research on expressive timing in music, present an original research project (as an example) on rubato in four performances of Bach’s Invention No. 9, explain and demonstrate how to use the freeware Sonic Visualiser as well as Excel for the analysis of expressive timing in music, and participants will, with the help of the tutorial leader, pursue their own analysis of other performances of Bach’s Invention No. 9. (Recordings will be provided.) We will combine the data collected (in Excel files) to look for similarities and differences in the various performances and how expressive timing correlates to certain musical features. (An analytical score of the piece will be provided.) We will collectively formulate research findings.

This tutorial is suitable for anyone who is curious about the topic. Beyond curiosity, participants do not need to have a music or computer science background. Those interested in participating in the analyses should bring a laptop (Windows computer or Mac) to the tutorial, with Sonic Visualiser (<http://sonicvisualiser.org>) and the VAMP plugin “Note Onset Detector” (<http://www.vamp-plugins.org>) installed.
