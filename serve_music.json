[{"UID":"389","abstract":"This work is a real-time, audio-driven system for augmented violin performance. Its paradigm is spatial (hence the title, \u201cA Room with\u2026\u201d) rather than instrumental. State changes interpolate between unique parameter configurations of the space composed through trial-and-error experimentation using themes/variations from J. S. Bach\u2019s Chaconne (Partita #2). Bespoke textural and ambient microsonic processing of the violin\u2019s sound by the composer is driven primarily by pitch estimation and other spectral features. In the sound design, Tim Hecker, William Basinski, Vangelis, Gas, and Klaus Schulze are all points of reference, and the ethos of the work is informed by the references of the latter two to late German Romantic music. The intention with performing this system using a famous piece from the violin repertoire (rather than free improvisation, the typical modus operandi of the composer) is to demonstrate to classically-trained musicians how they might discover novelty with the use of elaborate spatial augmentation systems as demonstrated by this performance. This seems especially important at the present moment, when musicians are sidelined from ensembles and seeking new ways to extend, rediscover, or reinvent their solo playing.","affiliation":"Arizona State University","authors":"","bb_id":"BV1mz4y1Z7pq","bio":"Dr. Seth Thorn is an American violinist whose research encompasses interaction design and philosophical approaches to computational media.

Despite the rich history of live vocal feature extraction, existing work frequently puts more focus on complex vocal sounds and textures, while engaging very little with the core fundamentals of standard vocalization \u2013 namely, the five primary singing vowels. Hence, VPF uses Max 8\u2019s spectral descriptors libraries in conjunction with Wekinator\u2019s machine learning models to train the system to detect one of the five core vowels (\u201cooh\u201d, \u201cee\u201d, \u201ceh\u201d, \u201cah\u201d, or \u201coh\u201d). The predicted vowel, along with the raw audio features themselves, are then used to control various parameters of live input processing, including harmonization, delay time (with feedback), and stereo spread.  Using this performance system, Spectre was composed as an improvisatory, experimental vocal work showcasing the hauntingly compelling sound worlds that can be created using Vocal PerFormants.

It all resonates a little too much with the natural thunderstorm in my hyperactive head.  // To cope, I attempt mindfulness. Actually, it is more to really enjoy my privileged life as is: an incredibly difficult task. I therefore share here a sonic musing on the pleasure of contemplating the complex ebb and flow of a million things that fight for attention, when I manage to lower the grip of its frenzy on my angst, guilt and powerlessness, and just observe it with an open curiosity.  // Attempts at Stillness was written in the composer\u2019s studio between April and November 2017.

In this composition, the composer wants to grasp the projection of four-dimensional objects: sound, in the three-dimensional world through a combination of various media. The sound part of piano material is generated by Magenta (Tensorflow) using a pre-trained model and reconstructed by the composer. All of the electronics and video parts are real-time transformed and generated by the live pianist's performance. Therefore, the pianist's performance, as well as live processing audio and video, creating lively intermedia experience to reveal the figuration of sound in the process of emergence, growth and distillation. Besides, this is a brand new attempt in mixed electroacoustic music creation using machine learning.","affiliation":"University of Manchester","authors":"","bb_id":"BV1Wt4y1v7no","bio":"Hongshuo Fan \u8303\u5f18\u7855 is a Chinese composer and new media artist.

This composition tries to find out. The running of a program is like a narrative: Once upon a time there was a poem about trees. The first word was \u201cI\u201d. It was stored at the root of a binary tree. The second word was \u201cthink\u201d. It was stored in a node pointed to by the right pointer of the \u201cI\u201d node. But this was a splay tree, and so the two nodes were rearranged so that \u201cthink\u201d was at the root. And so the story continues. The inspiration behind the composition was wondering whether following the construction of a search tree would result in a fractal-like composition, with related patterns occurring, to provide repetition for the listener \u2014 a method of providing compositional structure without resorting to existing forms and traditional techniques. A second inspiration behind the work was the idea of sonifying code, to provide feedback to a programmer in a new way, for example, about where possible inefficiencies lie. In the case of the chosen algorithm and data structure, each time two words are compared, the words are repeated for each character that needs to be compared, leading to the sequence \u201cthat, think, that, think, that, think\u201d being sung, due to the first three characters needing to be compared. In terms of the concert theme of \u201cmusic information\u201d, the work communicates information about a computer program via musical output. It also renders musically a method of storing and retrieving information.","affiliation":"RMIT University","authors":"","bb_id":"BV18k4y1C7CA","bio":"Alexandra L.
