[{"UID":"1-01","abstract":"This paper describes a statistical music structure analysis method that splits an audio signal of popular music into musically meaningful sections at the beat level and classifies them into predefined categories such as intro, verse, and chorus, where beat times are assumed to be estimated in advance. A basic approach to this task is to train a recurrent neural network (e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) network) that directly predicts section labels from acoustic features. This approach, however, suffers from frequent musically unnatural label switching because the homogeneity, repetitiveness, and duration regularity of musical sections are hard to represent explicitly in the network architecture. To solve this problem, we formulate a unified hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) that represents the generative process of homogeneous mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients, repetitive chroma features, and mel spectra from section labels, where the emission probabilities of mel spectra are computed from the posterior probabilities of section labels predicted by an LSTM. Given these acoustic features, the most likely label sequence can be estimated with Viterbi decoding. The experimental results show that the proposed LSTM-HSMM hybrid model outperformed a conventional HSMM.","affiliations":" Kyoto University|Kyoto University|Kyoto University","authors":"Go Shibata|Ryo Nishikimi|Kazuyoshi Yoshii","bb_id":"BV1DZ4y1578c","channel_name":"poster-1-01-shibata","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01AATJ56D9","day":"1","keywords":"Musical features and properties|Structure, segmentation, and form","pic_id":"5","primary_author":"Go Shibata","primary_email":"gshibata@sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp","session":"1","slot":"1","title":"Music Structure Analysis Based on an LSTM-HSMM Hybrid Model","yt_id":"LJ9og9C7QCc"},{"UID":"3-01","abstract":"This paper describes a clustering-based music transcription method that estimates the piano rolls of arbitrary musical instrument parts from multi-instrument polyphonic music signals. If target musical pieces are always played by particular kinds of musical instruments, a way to obtain piano rolls is to compute the pitchgram (pitch saliency spectrogram) of each musical instrument by using a deep neural network (DNN). However, this approach has a critical limitation that it has no way to deal with musical pieces including undefined musical instruments. To overcome this limitation, we estimate a condensed pitchgram with an existing instrument-independent neural multi-pitch estimator and then separate the pitchgram into a specified number of musical instrument parts with a deep spherical clustering technique. To improve the performance of transcription, we propose a joint spectrogram and pitchgram clustering method based on the timbral and pitch characteristics of musical instruments. The experimental results show that the proposed method can transcribe musical pieces including unknown musical instruments as well as those containing only predefined instruments, at the state-of-the-art transcription accuracy.","affiliations":"Waseda University|Waseda University|Kyoto University|Kyoto University|Waseda Research Institute for Science and Engineering","authors":"Keitaro Tanaka|Takayuki Nakatsuka|Ryo Nishikimi|Kazuyoshi Yoshii|Shigeo Morishima","bb_id":"BV1RD4y1R7PY","channel_name":"poster-3-01-tanaka","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01CC1EGK44","day":"2","keywords":"MIR tasks|Music transcription and annotation","pic_id":"6","primary_author":"Keitaro Tanaka","primary_email":"phys.keitaro1227@ruri.waseda.jp","session":"3","slot":"1","title":"Multi-instrument Music Transcription Based on Deep Spherical Clustering of Spectrograms and Pitchgrams","yt_id":"3QwkP466b5I"},{"UID":"2-01","abstract":"This paper explores sequential modelling of polyphonic music with deep neural networks.

The authors hypothesize that when a person listens to novel (i.e., both unfamiliar and interesting) pieces of music, the retention rate will be proportional to the number of times the discovery engine suggests the pieces to her, as long as they remain novel. The authors have tested the hypothesis through a six-week human-subject experiment that simulates a real-world listening environment and a follow-up survey. During the experiment period, each subject received, through Discover Weekly in Spotify, suggestions for novel songs up to three times and provided evaluation. One month after the evaluation experiment, the human-subjects answered whether they had revisited the novel songs. Through the analysis of the response and survey data, the researchers conclude that the more times a listener is exposed to a song during the discovery process, the more likely she is to return to the song.","affiliations":"University of Miami|University of Miami, USA","authors":"Brian Manolovitz|Mitsunori Ogihara","bb_id":"BV1BT4y1c75u","channel_name":"poster-5-01-manolovitz","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01C60QQ14J","day":"3","keywords":"Human-centered MIR|User-centered evaluation|Applications|Music recommendation and playlist generation|Personalization|User behavior analysis and mining, user modeling","pic_id":"13","primary_author":"Brian Manolovitz","primary_email":"bmm157@miami.edu","session":"5","slot":"1","title":"Practical Evaluation of Repeated Recommendations in Personalized Music Discovery","yt_id":"HECYI73cJlM"},{"UID":"6-01","abstract":"Even though local tempo estimation promises musicological insights into expressive musical performances, it has never received as much attention in the music information retrieval (MIR) research community as either beat tracking or global tempo estimation.

We build a neural network classification model and evaluate its ability to generalize across different performances and leitmotif occurrences.

However, in practice, there is often a lack of strongly aligned training data, in particular for real-world scenarios. In our study, we use weakly aligned score\u2013audio pairs for training, where only the beginning and end of a score excerpt is annotated in an audio recording, without aligned correspondences in between. To exploit such weakly aligned data, we employ the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to train a deep learning model for computing an enhanced chroma representation. We then apply this model to a cross-modal retrieval task, where we aim at finding relevant audio recordings of Western classical music, given a short monophonic musical theme in symbolic notation as a query. We present systematic experiments that show the effectiveness of the CTC-based model for this theme-based retrieval task.","affiliations":"International Audio Laboratories Erlangen|International Audio Laboratories Erlangen","authors":"Frank Zalkow|Meinard M\u00fcller","bb_id":"BV1NV41127Rs","channel_name":"poster-2-03-zalkow","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01BR3U4539","day":"1","keywords":"Applications|Music retrieval systems|Domain knowledge|Machine learning/Artificial intelligence for music|Representations of music|MIR fundamentals and methodology|Music signal processing|MIR tasks|Alignment, synchronization, and score following|Musical features and properties|Harmony, chords, and tonality","pic_id":"23","primary_author":"Frank Zalkow","primary_email":"frank.zalkow@audiolabs-erlangen.de","session":"2","slot":"2","title":"Using Weakly Aligned Score\u2013audio Pairs to Train Deep Chroma Models for Cross-modal Music Retrieval","yt_id":"5Kcmev0hOhU"},{"UID":"4-02","abstract":"This paper presents a method for large-scale retrieval of piano sheet music images.

Recent re-search has attempted to develop objective methods based on automated similarity algorithms, but there remains almost no data on the role of perceived similarity in mu-sic copyright decisions despite its crucial role in copy-right law. We collected perceptual data from 20 partici-pants for 17 adjudicated copyright cases from the USA and Japan after editing the disputed sections to contain either full audio, melody only, or lyrics only. Due to the historical emphasis in legal opinions on melody as the key criterion for deciding infringement, we predicted that listening to melody-only versions would result in percep-tual judgements that more closely matched actual past legal decisions. Surprisingly, however, we found no sig-nificant differences between the three conditions, with participants matching past decisions in between 50-60% of cases in all three conditions. Automated algorithms designed to calculate melodic and audio similarity pro-duced comparable results: both algorithms were able to match past decisions with identical accuracy of 71% (12/17 cases). Analysis of cases that were difficult to classify suggests that melody, lyrics, and other factors sometimes interact in complex ways difficult to capture using quantitative metrics. We propose directions for fur-ther investigation of the role of similarity in music copy-right law using larger and more diverse samples of cases and enhanced methods, and adapting our perceptual ex-periment method to avoid relying for ground truth data only on court decisions (which may be subject to selec-tion bias). Our results contribute to important practical debates, such as whether jury members should be allowed to listen to full audio recordings during copyright cases.

We exploit these visualizations of diatonic scale content by discussing their musicological implications, being aware of methodological limitations as for the case of minor keys. As a proof of concept, we use this method for investigating differences between the traditional sonata-form model and selected Beethoven piano sonatas in the context of sonata theory from the end of the 18th century.

To better understand user motivations for making NSQs, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with voice users.

Although chorus-section detection using audio signals has been studied, whether chorus sections can be detected from text-only lyrics is an open issue. Another open issue is whether patterns of repeating lyric lines such as those appearing in chorus sections depend on language. To investigate these issues, we propose a neural network-based model for sequence labeling. It can learn phrase repetition and linguistic features to detect chorus sections in lyrics text. It is, however, difficult to train this model since there was no dataset of lyrics with chorus-section annotations as there was no prior work on this task. We therefore generate a large amount of training data with such annotations by leveraging pairs of musical audio signals and their corresponding manually time-aligned lyrics; we first automatically detect chorus sections from the audio signals and then use their temporal positions to transfer them to the line-level chorus-section annotations for the lyrics. Experimental results show that the proposed model with the generated data contributes to detecting the chorus sections, that the model trained on Japanese lyrics can detect chorus sections surprisingly well in English lyrics and that patterns of repeating lyric lines are language-independent.","affiliations":"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology|National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology","authors":"Kento Watanabe|Masataka Goto","bb_id":"BV1jh41197ML","channel_name":"poster-3-04-watanabe","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01BZ4NLFPY","day":"2","keywords":"MIR fundamentals and methodology|Lyrics and other textual data, web mining, and natural language |Musical features and properties|Structure, segmentation, and form","pic_id":"88","primary_author":"Kento Watanabe","primary_email":"kento.watanabe@aist.go.jp","session":"3","slot":"1","title":"A Chorus-section Detection Method for Lyrics Text","yt_id":"sbmvfvNElOc"},{"UID":"1-04","abstract":"Music arrangement generation is a subtask of automatic music generation, which involves reconstructing and re-conceptualizing a piece with new compositional techniques.

With such limitations, an algorithm generating merely chord symbols is usually insufficient for a wide range of music genres such as jazz. To solve this problem, we propose chord jazzification, a process to generate realistic chord configurations in jazz style. With deep learning approaches, we decompose chord jazzification into coloring and voicing. Coloring concerns the choice of color tones, while voicing concerns the configurations of chords. We also create a new dataset featuring interpretations of chord symbols in pop-jazz compositions. By conducting experiments on the new dataset, we show that 1) the two-stage process outperforms an end-to-end generation approach in modeling chord configurations, and 2) attention-based models are better at capturing the structure of chord sequences in comparison with recurrent neural networks.","affiliations":"Academia Sinica|National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology|National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology|Academia Sinica","authors":"Tsung-Ping Chen|Satoru Fukayama|Masataka Goto|Li Su","bb_id":"BV1bv411y7cL","channel_name":"poster-3-05-chen","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01CJFA0NGH","day":"2","keywords":"Musical features and properties|Harmony, chords, and tonality|Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility|Novel datasets and use cases|MIR fundamentals and methodology|Symbolic music processing","pic_id":"90","primary_author":"Tsung-Ping Chen","primary_email":"tearfulcanon@iis.sinica.edu.tw","session":"3","slot":"1","title":"Chord Jazzification: Learning Jazz Interpretations of Chord Symbols","yt_id":"59_zJZtvGJ0"},{"UID":"5-05","abstract":"While deep generative models have become the leading methods for algorithmic composition, it remains a challenging problem to control the generation process because the latent variables of most deep-learning models lack good interpretability.

Prototypical modulation plans can be learned in an unsupervised manner by training a mixture model (similar to a Gaussian mixture model) on the data, so that different prototypes appear as distinct clusters.We evaluate our approach by performing hierarchical clustering on a corpus of more than 150 Baroque pieces, with the extracted clusters showing excellent agreement with the most common prototypes postulated in music theory. Our method bears a great potential for modelling, analysis and discovery of hierarchical key structure and prototypes in corpora across a broad range of musical styles.

In this paper, we address generation of personalized music and propose a novel pipeline for music generation that learns and optimizes user-specific musical taste. We focus on the task of symbol-based, monophonic, harmony-constrained jazz improvisations. Our personalization pipeline begins with BebopNet, a music language model trained on a corpus of jazz improvisations by Bebop giants. BebopNet is able to generate improvisations based on any given chord progression. We then assemble a personalized dataset, labeled by a specific user, and train a user-specific metric that reflects this user's unique musical taste. Finally, we employ a personalized variant of beam-search with BebopNet to optimize the generated jazz improvisations for that user. We present an extensive empirical study in which we apply this pipeline to extract individual models as implicitly defined by several human listeners. Our approach enables an objective examination of subjective personalized models whose performance is quantifiable. The results indicate that it is possible to model and optimize personal jazz preferences and offer a foundation for future research in personalized generation of art. We also briefly discuss opportunities, challenges, and questions that arise from our work, including issues related to creativity.","affiliations":"Technion|Technion|Technion","authors":"Shunit Haviv Hakimi|Nadav Bhonker|Ran El-Yaniv","bb_id":"BV1iV41117Kr","channel_name":"poster-6-08-haviv-hakimi","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01CJKT6NQH","day":"3","keywords":"Domain knowledge|Machine learning/Artificial intelligence for music|Applications|Music composition, performance, and production|Human-centered MIR|Personalization","pic_id":"132","primary_author":"Shunit Haviv Hakimi","primary_email":"shunithaviv@gmail.com","session":"6","slot":"2","title":"BebopNet: Deep Neural Models for Personalized Jazz Improvisations","yt_id":"oNJmBT6eYBU"},{"UID":"2-08","abstract":"More and more music is becoming available digitally, increasing the need to navigate through large numbers of audio tracks easily. One approach for improving the browsing experience is music thumbnailing: the procedure of finding a continuous fragment that can represent the whole musical piece. This paper proposes a human-centred approach to creating thumbnails based on listeners' perception, directly asking listeners to identify the most characteristic fragment. We carried out a user study to assign representativeness scores to multiple fragments from a selection of popular music tracks. To strengthen the results, we performed a replication of the same user study with new participants and a different set of music. Thereafter, we used audio features, the segmentation algorithm, and participants' overall familiarity with the songs to predict representativeness scores. The results suggest that neither segmentation nor familiarity have a significant impact on users' thumbnail preferences: even segments with starting points that pay no regard to song structure can be suitable thumbnails. Three high-level audio characteristics, however, do impact the perceived representativeness of a fragment: Raw Intensity, Melodic Conventionality, and Conventionally of Intensity. Based on these findings, we propose a new, easy-to-apply method for music thumbnailing.","affiliations":"None|University of Amsterdam|Utrecht University|Utrecht University","authors":"Arianne N. van Nieuwenhuijsen|John Ashley Burgoyne|Frans Wiering|Mick Sneekes","bb_id":"BV1Tk4y1C7ye","channel_name":"poster-2-08-van-nieuwenhuijsen","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01CVM4BQBA","day":"1","keywords":"MIR tasks|Music summarization|Applications|Music retrieval systems|Human-centered MIR|User behavior analysis and mining, user modeling","pic_id":"133","primary_author":"Arianne N. van Nieuwenhuijsen","primary_email":"anvannieuwenhuijsen@gmail.com","session":"2","slot":"2","title":"A Simple Method for User-driven Music Thumbnailing","yt_id":"VmZmSqG_wdA"},{"UID":"3-09","abstract":"In May 2015, a consultant for country radio revealed a decades\u2019 long practice of limiting space for songs by female artists.

First, we analyze the perception of beat and meter by asking 10 Colombian musicians to perform beat annotations in a dataset of bambucos. Results show  great diversity in the annotations: a total of five different meters or meter combinations were found in the annotations, with each bambuco in the study being annotated in at least two different meters. Second, we perform a beat tracking analysis in a dataset of bambucos with two state-of-the-art algorithms.  Given that the algorithms used in the analysis were designed to deal with the rhythmic regularity of a single meter, it is not surprising that tracking performance is not very high (~42% mean F-measure). However, a deeper analysis of  the onset detection functions used for beat tracking, indicate that there is enough information on the signal level to characterize the bi-metric behavior of bambucos. With this in mind, we highlight possibilities for computational analysis of rhythm in bambucos.","affiliations":"Fraunhofer IDMT|Universidad de Antioquia|Universidad de Antioquia|Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana|Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana|Universidad de Antioquia|Universidad de Antioquia","authors":"Estefania Cano|Fernando Mora \u00c1ngel|Gustavo Adolfo L\u00f3pez Gil|Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Zapata|Antonio Escamilla|Juan Fernando Alzate Londo\u00f1o|Moises Betancur Pelaez","bb_id":"BV1ap4y1Y7Xe","channel_name":"poster-3-11-cano","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01CVMRJRS4","day":"2","keywords":"Domain knowledge|Computational music theory and musicology|Applications|Digital libraries and archives|Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility|Novel datasets and use cases|Musical features and properties|Rhythm, beat, tempo","pic_id":"156","primary_author":"Estefania Cano","primary_email":"estefaniacano@gmail.com","session":"3","slot":"1","title":"Sesquialtera in the Colombian Bambuco: Perception and Estimation of Beat and Meter","yt_id":"ZC8OxT1JZgU"},{"UID":"1-10","abstract":"Music is hierarchically structured, in which the global attributes (e.g., the determined tonal structure, musical form) dominate the distribution of local elements (e.g., pitch, playing technique arrangement).

However, we argue that structural information is critical for both global and local tasks, particularly considering the characteristics of Guqin music. Incorporating mode and playing technique analysis, this study demonstrates that the structural relationship between notes is crucial for detecting mode, and such information also provides extra guidance for the playing technique detection in local-level. In this study, a new dataset is compiled for Guqin performance analysis. The mode detection is achieved by pattern matching, and the predicted results are conjoined with audio features to be inputted into a neural network for playing technique detection. Advanced techniques are developed to optimize the extracted pitch contour from the audio. It is manifest in the results that the global and local features are inter-connected in Guqin music.

The method treats tempo as a variable rather than a constant (with constraints), allowing the program to adapt to live performance variations. This is first expressed by a Kalman filter model at the note level, and then by an almost equivalent switching state-space model at the audio frame level. The latter contains both discrete and continuous hidden variables, and is computationally intractable. We show how certain reasonable approximations make the computation manageable. This new method is tested on a dataset of 50 piano excerpts. Compared with a previously established state-of-the-art algorithm, the new method shows more stable and accurate results: it reduces fatal score-following errors, and improves accuracy from 65.0% to 69.1%.","affiliations":"University of Richmond","authors":"Yucong Jiang","bb_id":"BV1x54y1R7Df","channel_name":"poster-5-09-jiang","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01C67139PD","day":"3","keywords":"MIR tasks|Alignment, synchronization, and score following|Domain knowledge|Machine learning/Artificial intelligence for music|MIR fundamentals and methodology|Music signal processing","pic_id":"159","primary_author":"Yucong Jiang","primary_email":"yjiang3@richmond.edu","session":"5","slot":"1","title":"Score Following with Hidden Tempo Using a Switching State-space Model","yt_id":"LFatECSjccY"},{"UID":"1-11","abstract":"The lack of labeled data is a major obstacle in many music information retrieval tasks such as melody extraction, where labeling is extremely laborious or costly.

In this paper, we propose an SSL method using teacher-student models for vocal melody extraction. The teacher model is pre-trained with labeled data and guides the student model to make identical predictions given unlabeled input in a self-training setting. We examine three setups of teacher-student models with different data augmentation schemes and loss functions. Also, considering the scarcity of labeled data in the test phase, we artificially generate large-scale testing data with pitch labels from unlabeled data using an analysis-synthesis method. The results show that the SSL method significantly increases the performance against supervised learning only and the improvement depends on the teacher-student models, the size of unlabeled data, the number of self-training iterations, and other training details. We also find that it is essential to ensure that the unlabeled audio has vocal parts. Finally, we show that the proposed SSL method allows a simple convolutional recurrent neural network model to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-arts.","affiliations":"KAIST|Academia Sinica|Academia Sinica|KAIST","authors":"Sangeun Kum|Jing-Hua Lin|Li Su|Juhan Nam","bb_id":"BV1nz4y1o7wk","channel_name":"poster-1-11-kum","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01CJE0MH89","day":"1","keywords":"Musical features and properties|Melody and motives|Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility|Novel datasets and use cases|MIR tasks|Music transcription and annotation","pic_id":"160","primary_author":"Sangeun Kum","primary_email":"keums@kaist.ac.kr","session":"1","slot":"1","title":"Semi-supervised Learning Using Teacher-student Models for Vocal Melody Extraction","yt_id":"OOyxSCUHqtQ"},{"UID":"5-10","abstract":"Disentangling factors of variation aims to uncover latent variables that underlie the process of data generation.

Our framework, based on variational auto-encoders, takes as input a spectral frame, and encodes pitch and timbre as categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The input is then reconstructed by combining those variables. Under an unsupervised training setting, a major challenge is that encoders are tasked to capture factors of interest with distinct latent representations, without access to the corresponding ground-truth labels. We therefore introduce auxiliary tasks and objectives which leverage pitch shifting as a strategy to create surrogate labels, thereby encouraging the disentanglement of pitch and timbre. Through an ablation study we analyze the impact of the proposed objectives. The evaluation shows the efficacy of the proposed framework for learning disentangled representations, and verifies its applicability to unsupervised pitch classification and conditional spectral synthesis.","affiliations":"Singapore University of Technology and Design|Singapore University of Technology and Design|National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology|National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology|Singapore University of Technology and Design","authors":"Yin-Jyun Luo|Kin Wai Cheuk|Tomoyasu Nakano|Masataka Goto|Dorien Herremans","bb_id":"BV1354y1C7Fm","channel_name":"poster-5-10-luo","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01C60Y90F4","day":"3","keywords":"Domain knowledge|Machine learning/Artificial intelligence for music","pic_id":"162","primary_author":"Yin-Jyun Luo","primary_email":"yinjyun_luo@mymail.sutd.edu.sg","session":"5","slot":"1","title":"Unsupervised Disentanglement of Pitch and Timbre for Isolated Musical Instrument Sounds","yt_id":"hEiekTZF3As"},{"UID":"3-12","abstract":"When making judgements, humans are known to be better at choosing a preferred option amongst a small number of options, rather than giving an absolute ranking of all the options.

We adopt a twin-neural network (Siamese) that learns to choose a preferred candidate in terms of singing quality between two inputs. With a few such pairwise comparisons, this method generates a relative rank-order of a complete list of singers. Additionally, we incorporate a knowledge-based musically-relevant pitch histogram representation, as a conditioning vector, to provide explicit musical information to the network. The experiments show that this method is able to reliably evaluate singing quality and rank-order singing vocals, independent of the song or the singer. The results suggest that the twin-neural network learns the underlying discerning properties relevant to singing quality, instead of being specific to the content of a song or singer.","affiliations":"National University of Singapore|National University of Singapore|National University of Singapore","authors":"Chitralekha Gupta|Lin Huang|Haizhou Li","bb_id":"BV1Ei4y1j7rx","channel_name":"poster-3-12-gupta","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01C5SDC4HY","day":"2","keywords":"Domain knowledge|Machine learning/Artificial intelligence for music|Applications|Music training and education|Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility|Evaluation methodology|MIR fundamentals and methodology|Music signal processing|MIR tasks|Similarity metrics|Musical features and properties|Timbre, instrumentation, and voice","pic_id":"165","primary_author":"Chitralekha Gupta","primary_email":"chitralekha@nus.edu.sg","session":"3","slot":"1","title":"Automatic Rank-ordering of Singing Vocals with Twin-neural Network","yt_id":"uDMxr414f-4"},{"UID":"5-11","abstract":"Machine learning is challenging the way we make music. Although research in deep generative models has dramatically improved the capability and fluency of music models, recent work has shown that it can be challenging for humans to partner with this new class of algorithms. In this paper, we present findings on what 13 musician/developer teams, a total of 61 users, needed when co-creating a song with AI, the challenges they faced, and how they leveraged and repurposed existing characteristics of AI to overcome some of these challenges. Many teams adopted modular approaches, such as independently running multiple smaller models that align with the musical building blocks of a song, before re-combining their results. As ML models are not easily steerable, teams also generated massive numbers of samples and curated them post-hoc, or used a range of strategies to direct the generation or algorithmically ranked the samples. Ultimately, teams not only had to manage the ``flare and focus'' aspects of the creative process, but also juggle that with a parallel process of exploring and curating multiple ML models and outputs. These findings reflect a need to design machine learning-powered music interfaces that are more decomposable, steerable, interpretable, and adaptive, which in return will enable artists to more effectively explore how AI can extend their personal expression.

Overall similarity is the degree to which the characteristics of a song are similar overall to the characteristics of the artist; while prominent affinity is the degree to which a song prominently represents the characteristics of the artist. By using Last.fm play logs for two years, we analyze the characteristics of the concepts. Moreover, based on the analysis results, we propose three applications for song search.

This allows to obtain models which are effectively lighter in terms of size, memory and number of operations.We show that our proposal allows to remove up to 95% of the models parameters without loss of accuracy, leading to ultra-light deep MIR models. We confirm the surprising result that, at smaller compression ratios (removing up to 90% of the network), lighter models consistently outperform their heavier counterpart. We exhibit these results on a large array of MIR tasks including audio classification, pitch recognition, chord extraction, drum transcription and onset estimation. These resulting ultra-light deep models for MIR can run on CPU, and can even fit on embedded devices with minimal degradation of accuracy.

This indicates the potential of unsupervised predictive learning with deep neural networks as means to retrieve musical structure from audio and as a basis to uncover the corresponding cognitive processes in the human brain.","affiliations":"Otto von Guericke University|Otto von Guericke University","authors":"Andr\u00e9 Ofner|Sebastian Stober","bb_id":"BV11A41177Ed","channel_name":"poster-4-13-ofner","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01C2SZDFA9","day":"2","keywords":"Domain knowledge|Machine learning/Artificial intelligence for music|Cognitive MIR|Representations of music|Human-centered MIR|Personalization|MIR fundamentals and methodology|Multimodality|Musical features and properties|Rhythm, beat, tempo","pic_id":"219","primary_author":"Andr\u00e9 Ofner","primary_email":"ofner@ovgu.de","session":"4","slot":"2","title":"Modeling Perception with Hierarchical Prediction: Auditory Segmentation with Deep Predictive Coding Locates Candidate Evoked Potentials in EEG","yt_id":"fOKp7lMmzMc"},{"UID":"1-13","abstract":"High-level musical qualities (such as emotion) are often abstract, subjective, and hard to quantify. Given these difficulties, it is not easy to learn good feature representations with supervised learning techniques, either because of the insufficiency of labels, or the subjectiveness (and hence large variance) in human-annotated labels. In this paper, we present a framework that can learn high-level feature representations with a limited amount of data, by first modelling their corresponding quantifiable low-level attributes. We refer to our proposed framework as Music FaderNets, which is inspired by the fact that low-level attributes can be continuously manipulated by separate \"sliding faders\" through feature disentanglement and latent regularization techniques. High-level features are then inferred from the low-level representations through semi-supervised clustering using Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders (GM-VAEs). Using arousal as an example of a high-level feature, we show that the \"faders\" of our model are disentangled and change linearly w.r.t. the modelled low-level attributes of the generated output music. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model successfully learns the intrinsic relationship between arousal and its corresponding low-level attributes (rhythm and note density), with only 1% of the training set being labelled. Finally, using the learnt high-level feature representations, we explore the application of our framework in style transfer tasks across different arousal states. The effectiveness of this approach is verified through a subjective listening test.","affiliations":"Singapore University of Technology and Design|Singapore University of Technology and Design","authors":"HAO HAO TAN|Dorien Herremans","bb_id":"BV1aa4y1L7pZ","channel_name":"poster-1-13-tan","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01C2NES3NH","day":"1","keywords":"Domain knowledge|Machine learning/Artificial intelligence for music|MIR tasks|Music synthesis and transformation","pic_id":"222","primary_author":"HAO HAO TAN","primary_email":"haohao_tan@sutd.edu.sg","session":"1","slot":"1","title":"Music Fadernets: Controllable Music Generation Based on High-level Features via Low-level Feature Modelling","yt_id":"BI3QNav6DI0"},{"UID":"4-14","abstract":"In this paper, we undertake a critical assessment of a state-of-the-art deep neural network approach for computational rhythm analysis.

Both approaches work well, but largely reduce modes to scales and ignore their melodic character.

Thirdly, if so, can we find acoustic features that are related to human judgments of acoustic similarity? To answer these questions, our study asked 117 test subjects to compare two unknown candidate songs relative to a third known reference song.

We use subjective listening test to evaluate perceptual factors of our proposed system for synthesis, including quality, adherence to the melody as well the degree of perceived unison.","affiliations":"Universitat Pompeu Fabra|Universitat Pompeu Fabra|Universitat Pompeu Fabra","authors":"Pritish Chandna|Helena Cuesta|Emilia Gomez","bb_id":"BV1Qt4y1v7Qc","channel_name":"poster-4-17-chandna","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01CJJYEDU1","day":"2","keywords":"MIR tasks|Music synthesis and transformation|Applications|Music retrieval systems|Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility|Human-centered MIR|User-centered evaluation|Musical features and properties|Expression and performative aspects of music","pic_id":"259","primary_author":"Pritish Chandna","primary_email":"pritish.chandna@upf.edu","session":"4","slot":"2","title":"A Deep Learning Based Analysis-synthesis Framework for Unison Singing","yt_id":"YAz-0LLJC94"},{"UID":"4-18","abstract":"Open-source software libraries for audio/music analysis and feature extraction have a significant impact on the development of Audio Signal Processing and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems.

The most commonly practiced setting for choir ensembles consists of four parts; Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass (SATB), each with its own range of fundamental frequencies (F0s). The task of source separation for this choral setting entails separating the SATB mixture into the constituent parts. Source separation for musical mixtures is well studied and many deep learning based methodologies have been proposed for the same. However, most of the research has been focused on a typical case which consists in separating vocal, percussion and bass sources from a mixture, each of which has a distinct spectral structure. In contrast, the simultaneous and harmonic nature of ensemble singing leads to high structural similarity and overlap between the spectral components of the sources in a choral mixture, making source separation for choirs a harder task than the typical case. This, along with the lack of an appropriate consolidated dataset has led to a dearth of research in the field so far. In this paper we first assess how well some of the recently developed methodologies for musical source separation perform for the case of SATB choirs. We then propose a novel domain-specific adaptation for conditioning the recently proposed U-Net architecture for musical source separation using the fundamental frequency contour of each of the singing groups and demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses results from domain-agnostic architectures.","affiliations":"Universitat Pompeu Fabra|Universitat Pompeu Fabra|Universitat Pompeu Fabra|Universitat Pompeu Fabra|Universitat Pompeu Fabra","authors":"Darius Petermann|Pritish Chandna|Helena Cuesta|Jordi Bonada|Emilia Gomez","bb_id":"BV1My4y1r7bJ","channel_name":"poster-5-14-petermann","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01C610T30A","day":"3","keywords":"MIR tasks|Music synthesis and transformation|Applications|Music composition, performance, and production|Music retrieval systems|Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility|Novel datasets and use cases|MIR fundamentals and methodology|Music signal processing","pic_id":"276","primary_author":"Darius Petermann","primary_email":"dariusarthur.petermann01@estudiant.upf.edu","session":"5","slot":"1","title":"Deep Learning Based Source Separation Applied to Choir Ensembles","yt_id":"4A1Up4S3plQ"},{"UID":"4-19","abstract":"A piece of music can be expressively performed, or interpreted, in a variety of ways.

In this paper we present a single representation learning framework that elucidates the relationship between metric learning, classification, and disentanglement in a holistic manner. For this, we (1) outline past work on the relationship between metric learning and classification, (2) extend this relationship to multi-label data by exploring three different learning approaches and their disentangled versions, and (3) evaluate all models on four tasks (training time, similarity retrieval, auto-tagging, and triplet prediction).

Although most users agreed that diversity is beneficial in music discovery, they also noted a risk of dissatisfaction from too much diversity. A key finding is that preference for diversification was often linked to user mood. Participants also expressed a clear distinction between diversity within existing preferences, and outside of existing preferences. These ideas of inner and outer diversity are not well defined within the bounds of current diversity metrics, and we discuss their implications.","affiliations":"University of Waterloo|University of Waterloo|Johannes Kepler University Linz","authors":"Kyle Robinson|Dan Brown|Markus Schedl","bb_id":"BV15D4y1d7kD","channel_name":"poster-3-16-robinson","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01BR640B8F","day":"2","keywords":"Human-centered MIR|User-centered evaluation|Applications|Music recommendation and playlist generation|Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility|Evaluation metrics|Human-computer interaction and interfaces|Personalization","pic_id":"311","primary_author":"Kyle Robinson","primary_email":"kyle.robinson@uwaterloo.ca","session":"3","slot":"1","title":"User Insights on Diversity in Music Recommendation Lists","yt_id":"qJhtwpjNP_c"},{"UID":"6-20","abstract":"This paper presents exploratory work investigating the suitability of the Music Ontology - the most widely used formal specification of the music domain - for modelling non-Western musical traditions.

Music genres are valuable information, especially for music organization, personalized listening experience, and playlist generation. Automatically classifying music genres is a challenging endeavor due to the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity. Most efforts on music genre classification consider the complete independence between labels. However, music genres typically respect a hierarchical structure based on the influences or origins of each style. Conversely, many of the methods available for hierarchical classification are based on assumptions about the class hierarchy, such as the need for multiple children in each hierarchy's node, which may limit their use in music applications. Also, the local classifier per node approach that would be the most suitable for this scenario is costly regarding time and memory. In this paper, we present two local hierarchical classification approaches and show how to combine them to obtain a single one that is more robust and faithful to the music genre classification scenario. We evaluate our proposal in a music dataset hierarchically labeled with 120 music genres. As shown, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach has a lower computational cost and can achieve competitive performances.","affiliations":"Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo|Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Carlos|","authors":"Antonio R.

For two audio clips with M and N frames, respectively, the most popular approach, dynamic time warping (DTW), has O(MN) requirements in both memory and computation, which is prohibitive for frame-level alignments at reasonable rates. To address this, a variety of memory efficient algorithms exist to approximate the optimal alignment under the DTW cost. To our knowledge, however, no exact algorithms exist that are guaranteed to break the quadratic memory barrier.  In this work, we present a divide and conquer algorithm that computes the exact globally optimal DTW alignment using O(M+N) memory. Its runtime is still O(MN), trading off memory for a 2x increase in computation.  However, the algorithm can be parallelized up to a factor of min(M, N) with the same memory constraints, so it can still run more efficiently than the textbook version with an adequate GPU. We use our algorithm to compute exact alignments on a collection of orchestral music, which we use as ground truth to benchmark the alignment accuracy of several popular approximate alignment schemes at scales that were not previously possible.","affiliations":"Ursinus College|Ursinus College","authors":"Christopher J Tralie|Elizabeth Dempsey","bb_id":"BV16A41177zN","channel_name":"poster-3-18-tralie","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01CJH1AJKT","day":"2","keywords":"MIR tasks|Alignment, synchronization, and score following|Applications|Music retrieval systems|Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility|Evaluation metrics","pic_id":"343","primary_author":"Christopher J Tralie","primary_email":"ctralie@alumni.princeton.edu","session":"3","slot":"1","title":"Exact, Parallelizable Dynamic Time Warping Alignment with Linear Memory","yt_id":"k4-Mlqe2vGQ"},{"UID":"5-17","abstract":"Recent years have witnessed great progress in using deep learning algorithms to learn to compose music in the form of a MIDI file.  However, whether such algorithms apply equally well to compose guitar tabs, which are quite different from MIDIs, remain relatively unexplored. To address this, we build a model for composing fingerstyle guitar tabs with a neural sequence model architecture called the Transformer-XL. With this model, we investigate the following research questions. First, whether the neural net generates note sequences with meaningful fingering (i.e., string-fret combinations), which is important for tabs but not for MIDIs. Second, whether it generates compositions with coherent rhythmic grooving, which is crucial for fingerstyle guitar music. And, finally, how pleasant the composed music is in comparison to real, human-made compositions. Our work provides preliminary empirical evidence for the promise of deep learning for guitar tab composition, and suggests areas for future study.","affiliations":"National Taiwan University|National Taiwan University|Taiwan AI Labs|Academia Sinica","authors":"Yu-Hua Chen|Yu-Siang Huang|Wen-Yi Hsiao|Yi-Hsuan Yang","bb_id":"BV1By4y1C7Uv","channel_name":"poster-5-17-chen","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01BZ90204W","day":"3","keywords":"Applications|Music composition, performance, and production|Domain knowledge|Machine learning/Artificial intelligence for music|Representations of music|MIR fundamentals and methodology|Symbolic music processing|MIR tasks|Music synthesis and transformation|Musical features and properties|Rhythm, beat, tempo","pic_id":"349","primary_author":"Yu-Hua Chen","primary_email":"r08946011@ntu.edu.tw","session":"5","slot":"1","title":"Automatic Composition of Guitar Tabs by Transformers and Groove Modeling","yt_id":"aXukC0-9Rn8"},{"UID":"5-18","abstract":"A DJ mix is a sequence of music tracks concatenated seamlessly, typically rendered for audiences in a live setting by a DJ on stage. As a DJ mix is produced in a studio or the live version is recorded for music streaming services, computational methods to analyze DJ mixes, for example, extracting track information or understanding DJ techniques, have drawn research interests. Many of previous works are, however, limited to identifying individual tracks in a mix or segmenting it, and the sizes of the datasets are usually small. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of DJ music by aligning a mix to its original music tracks. We set up the subsequence alignment such that the audio features are less sensitive to the tempo or key change of the original track in a mix. This approach provides temporally tight mix-to-track matching from which we can obtain cue-points, transition length, mix segmentation, and musical changes in DJ performance. Using 1,557 mixes from 1001Tracklists including 13,728 tracks and 20,765 transitions, we conduct the proposed analysis and show a wide range of statistics, which may elucidate the creative process of DJ music making.","affiliations":"KAIST|KAIST|1001Tracklists|Academia Sinica|KAIST","authors":"Taejun Kim|Minsuk Choi|Evan Sacks|Yi-Hsuan Yang|Juhan Nam","bb_id":"BV1LT4y1w7Z3","channel_name":"poster-5-18-kim","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01BR8RHBDM","day":"3","keywords":"Applications|Music composition, performance, and production|Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility|Novel datasets and use cases|MIR tasks|Alignment, synchronization, and score following|Musical features and properties|Structure, segmentation, and form","pic_id":"352","primary_author":"Taejun Kim","primary_email":"taejun@kaist.ac.kr","session":"5","slot":"1","title":"A Computational Analysis of Real-world DJ Mixes Using Mix-To-Track Subsequence Alignment","yt_id":"rC1e5XAyEQw"},{"UID":"1-18","abstract":"Dynamic prediction of perceived emotions of music is a challenging problem with interesting applications. Utilization of relevant context in audio sequence is essential for effective prediction. Existing methods have used LSTMs with modest success. In this work we describe three attentive LSTM based approaches for dynamic emotion prediction from music clips. We validate our models through extensive experimentation on standard dataset annotated with arousal-valence values in continuous time, and choose the best performer. We find that the LSTM based attention models perform better than the state of the art transformers for the dynamic emotion prediction task, both in terms of R2 and Kendall-Tau metrics. We explore individual smaller feature sets in search of a more effective one and to understand how different features contribute to perceived emotion. The spectral features are found to perform at par with the generic ComPare feature set [1]. Through attention map analysis we visualize how attention is distributed over music clips\u2019 frames for emotion prediction. It is observed that the models attend to frames which contribute to changes in reported arousal-valence values and chroma to produce better emotion predictions, effectively capturing long-term dependencies.","affiliations":"Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India|IIT Kharagpur|Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur|Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur","authors":"Sanga Chaki|Pranjal Doshi|Sourangshu Bhattacharya|Prof. Priyadarshi Patnaik","bb_id":"BV1ay4y1C7zu","channel_name":"poster-1-18-chaki","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01C2NS0AUV","day":"1","keywords":"Musical features and properties|Musical affect, emotion, and mood|Applications|Music recommendation and playlist generation|Music retrieval systems|Domain knowledge|Machine learning/Artificial intelligence for music|MIR tasks|Automatic classification|Pattern matching and detection","pic_id":"354","primary_author":"Sanga Chaki","primary_email":"s.chaki27@gmail.com","session":"1","slot":"1","title":"Explaining Perceived Emotion Predictions in Music: an Attentive Approach","yt_id":"nXE5ON2MXPY"},{"UID":"2-20","abstract":"This paper develops the hypothesis that symbolic drum patterns can be represented in a reduced form as a simple oscillation between two states, a Low state (commonly associated with kick drum events) and a High state (often associated with either snare drum or high hat). Both an onset time and an accent time is associated to each state. The systematic inference of the reduced form is formalized. This enables the specification of a rhythmic structural similarity measure on drum patterns, where reduced patterns are compared through alignment. The two-state representation allows a low computational cost alignment, once the complex topological formalization is fully taken into account. A comparison with the Hamming distance, as well as similarity ratings collected from listeners on a drum loop dataset, indicates that the bistate reduction enables to convey subtle aspects that goes beyond surface-level comparison of rhythmic textures.

Real-world events play a key role in shaping collective sentiment in a society. As people listen to music daily everywhere in the world, the sentiment of music being listened to can reflect the mood of the listeners and serve as a measure of collective sentiment. However, the exact relationship between real-world events and the sentiment of music being listened to is not clear. Driven by this research gap, we use the unexpected outbreak of COVID-19 as a natural experiment to explore how users' sentiment of music being listened to evolves before and during the outbreak of the pandemic. We employ causal inference approaches on an extended version of the LFM-1b dataset of listening events shared on Last.fm, to examine the impact of the pandemic on the sentiment of music listened to by users in different countries. We find that, after the first COVID-19 case in a country was confirmed, the sentiment of artists users listened to becomes more negative. This negative effect is pronounced for males while females' music emotion is less influenced by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further find a negative association between the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases and users' music sentiment. Our results provide empirical evidence that public sentiment can be monitored based on collective music listening behaviors, which can contribute to research in related disciplines.","affiliations":"HKU|University of Innsbruck|The University of Hong Kong|Johannes Kepler University Linz|Johannes Kepler University Linz","authors":"Meijun Liu|Eva Zangerle|Xiao Hu|Alessandro Melchiorre|Markus Schedl","bb_id":"","channel_name":"poster-1-19-liu","channel_url":"https://ismir2020.slack.com/archives/C01BR3N6ML7","day":"1","keywords":"Applications|Music retrieval systems|Music and health, well-being, and therapy|Music recommendation and playlist generation|Musical features and properties|Musical affect, emotion, and mood","pic_id":"362","primary_author":"Meijun Liu","primary_email":"meijun@hku.hk","session":"1","slot":"1","title":"Pandemics, Music, and Collective Sentiment: Evidence from the Outbreak of COVID-19","yt_id":"ar6ZQtZ1P7U"},{"UID":"4-20","abstract":"Temporality lies at the very heart of music, and the play with rhythmic and metrical structures constitutes a major device across musical styles and genres. Rhythmic and metrical structure are closely intertwined, particularly in the tonal idiom. While there have been many approaches for modeling musical tempo, beat and meter and their inference, musical rhythm and its complexity have been comparably less explored and formally modeled. The model formulates a generative grammar of symbolic rhythmic musical structure and its internal recursive substructure. The approach characterizes rhythmic groups in alignment with meter in terms of the recursive subdivision of temporal units, as well as dependencies established by recursive operations such as preparation and different kinds of shifting (such as anticipation and delay). The model is formulated in terms of an abstract context-free grammar and applies for monophonic rhythms and harmonic rhythm.
