Versions (or cover songs) convey the same musical entity while incorporating differences in several musical characteristics, including the differences in timbre, tempo, key, lyrics, and even added/deleted sections. The main applications include digital rights management and music catalog organization.\nFor more than a decade, VI systems suffered from the accuracy-scalability trade-off, with attempts to increase accuracy resulting in cumbersome, non-scalable systems. Recent years however have witnessed an increase in deep learning-based VI approaches that take a step toward bridging the accuracy-scalability gap, and we start seeing the possibility to deploy such systems in real-world applications. Although this trend positively influences the number of researchers and institutions working on VI, it may also result in obscuring the literature before the deep learning era. To appreciate the 20 years of novel ideas in VI and to facilitate building better systems in the next decade, we believe that now may be the right time to review some of the successful ideas and applications proposed in VI literature and connect them to current systems and ideas.\nWe will start the tutorial by explaining common input representations and feature post-processing steps. We will continue with comparing the pros and cons of alignment-based and embedding-based approaches, which constitute the two main perspectives for similarity estimation in VI. Lastly, after discussing a number of ideas that can be incorporated into any VI system, we will conclude by presenting the current challenges and future directions in VI research.
