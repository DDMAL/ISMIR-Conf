With the intention of integrating to the ISMIR community the
composers, technologists, performers, and creative practitioners
making use of music information for creating music, ISMIR 2020
announced an international call for musical works for inclusion in the
conference’s concert program.

The call encouraged contributions from any genre or style of music
exploring the notion of music information in the widest sense of the
term. Composers submitted pieces that either explore the use of AI-driven
systems to improvise or play along with humans, generating or assisting
the process of composition, or use common music information
retrieval tasks such as audio feature extraction, audio mosaicing,
harmonization, or intelligent looping in their pieces.

The submissions were scanned for relevance by the ISMIR2020 Music
Program co-chairs and at least two additional reviewers per musical
piece were assigned to provide evaluations. The final decision for
inclusion in the ISMIR Music Program was made based on the reviewers'
evaluations and comments.
